<h4><a href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq">gitlab</a></h4>

<p>Since 2012 I&#39;ve volunteered as a <a href="http://contributors.gitlab.com/contributors/robert-speicher/commits">contributor</a> to the popular
<a href="http://www.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> project, focusing mainly on cleaning up the existing code,
adding requested features and triaging tickets.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/pulls/tsigo?direction=desc&amp;page=1&amp;sort=created&amp;state=all">60 merged pull requests</a> and counting!</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/tsigo/video_dimensions">video_dimensions</a></h4>

<p>Quick and easy video attributes -- width, height, bitrate, codec, duration,
framerate.</p>

<p><strong>Tools used:</strong> Ruby, RSpec</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/tsigo/hubstar">hubstar</a></h4>

<p>HubStar <strike>provides</strike> provided the missing &quot;star&quot; feature for
GitHub repositories.</p>

<p>I was tired of my activity feed being clogged by projects I watched to remember
for later, but wasn&#39;t actively interested in things like their day-to-day
pushes and issue changes.</p>

<p>I had been using the Gitmarks Chrome extension for a while, but the problem was
that it only displayed the name of the project, which can sometimes be pretty
ambiguous, and I had trouble finding what I was looking for when I came back to
find it later. HubStar solves that issue by displaying more information about
the projects that I save.</p>

<p><strong>Tools used:</strong> Ruby 1.9, Rails 3.2, Heroku, PostgreSQL, OmniAuth, GitHub
OAuth, Octokit, CoffeeScript, jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, RSpec, FactoryGirl,
Shoulda</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/tsigo/gemphile">gemphile</a></h4>

<p>A Gemfile and gemspec indexer</p>

<p>For some developers, the best way to learn how to use a gem is to see how other
projects use it in the real world. But what if you can&#39;t easily find a project
that uses the gem you&#39;re trying to learn about? Gemphile was created to index
the Gemfiles and gemspecs of Ruby projects on GitHub and then to provide a
simple search interface to find those projects.</p>

<p><strong>Tools used:</strong> Ruby 1.9, Sinatra, MongoDB, Mongoid, Mustache, DelayedJob,
RSpec, FactoryGirl, WebMock, GitHub API v2</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/tsigo/wriggle">wriggle</a></h4>

<p>A simple Ruby directory crawler DSL</p>

<p><strong>Tools used:</strong> Ruby, RSpec, TravisCI</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/tsigo/invision_bridge">invision_bridge</a></h4>

<p>Allows your Authlogic-based User model to authenticate using an IP.Board 3.x database.</p>

<p><strong>Tools used:</strong> Ruby, ActiveRecord, Authlogic</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/tsigo/wowr">wowr</a> - forked from <a href="https://github.com/pwood/wowr">pwood</a></h4>

<p>Originally this gem&#39;s code was monolithic with few if any meaningful tests and
absolutely no API documentation. Together with <a href="https://github.com/ttdonovan">Tanner Donovan</a>, I
documented nearly all of the API, added nearly total test coverage and
refactored the code into smaller, logical chunks while maintaining backwards
compatibility with the legacy API.</p>
