#### [hubstar](https://github.com/tsigo/hubstar)

HubStar <strike>provides</strike> provided the missing "star" feature for
GitHub repositories.

I was tired of my activity feed being clogged by projects I watched to remember
for later, but wasn't actively interested in things like their day-to-day
pushes and issue changes.

I had been using the Gitmarks Chrome extension for a while, but the problem was
that it only displayed the name of the project, which can sometimes be pretty
ambiguous, and I had trouble finding what I was looking for when I came back to
find it later. HubStar solves that issue by displaying more information about
the projects that I save.

**Tools used:** Ruby 1.9, Rails 3.2, Heroku, PostgreSQL, OmniAuth, GitHub
OAuth, Octokit, CoffeeScript, jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, RSpec, FactoryGirl,
Shoulda

#### [gemphile](https://github.com/tsigo/gemphile)

A Gemfile and gemspec indexer

For some developers, the best way to learn how to use a gem is to see how other
projects use it in the real world. But what if you can't easily find a project
that uses the gem you're trying to learn about? Gemphile was created to index
the Gemfiles and gemspecs of Ruby projects on GitHub and then to provide a
simple search interface to find those projects.

**Tools used:** Ruby 1.9, Sinatra, MongoDB, Mongoid, Mustache, DelayedJob,
RSpec, FactoryGirl, WebMock, GitHub API v2
